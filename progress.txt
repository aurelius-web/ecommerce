- I used Blazor WebAssemply, because its a single page application, so a small project.
- I added the models (Category and Product class).
- Added ecommerce.Shared in uses to have the reference to the models.
- Added Telerik Blazor Components to my project.
- Created a list of random products.
- Then I created a Table using Telerik Grid Component, and added the products.
- Created function to show in and out of stock products and images. 
- Added Some CSS to style the text and alignment to make it more readable.


Overall very smooth walktrouh and instructions on documentation. Everything was
explain in details on Telerik Blazor documentation. As my first time using Telerik it
it was not difficult at all. Also, the next day of my registration a represantative 
called me to ask about my trial. I didn't have any problem although it was a very 
basic task.
